# reusable-github-workflows

Public repository containing [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) for GitHub actions. 

See the GitHub documentation on how to use reusable workflows in your projects.

For documentation & usage for the specific reusable workflows, see the specific markdown documentation for each workflow.

## Versioning

Currently there are no releases for these workflows & specific branches/commits are used when calling the workflows. Raise an issue if versioning/releases is needed.

## Contributing Reusable Workflows

See the [reusable workflows documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) for the specifics of creating your own reusable workflows.

When adding a reusable workflow, it must be contained in the top level of the `.github/workflows` directory. Also make sure sure to include a markdown document with the same name as the workflow `.yaml` file containing the details on how to use the workflow.
